Goals:
1. show how to use the repository to create an entity
2. show how to use the orm.xml to use a JPA Event listener to observe JPA events
3. show that when an entity is persisted, it is also indexed
4. show how to search for that entity using a generic API (can swap out underlying implementation, ie. ES for SOLR)
5. show how the bridge service works to "bridge" the gap between index and repository (JPA)

Notes:
1. not working
2. this project depends on us setting some encrypetd values (IVFilePath, KeyFilePath)
3. this project depends on the index bridge service to be configured / registered

Goals:
1. show how to capture metrics with little to no effort
2. all public methods will be captured via metrics

Notes:
1. this does not work, partially (mostly) because Gauge and Histogram are not implemented

2. application should run indefinitely
3. while running, all public methods should be captured via:
    Timer
    Gauge
    Counter
    Summary
4. statistics are pulled from prometheus to the endpoint automatically setup at startup :8181
5. I don't like the idea of exposing a scraper, instead, why not try to push directly to prometheus?
	prometheus does NOT work this way (the last time I checked, NOTED: 2019/07/16, probably checked 2018/07/01 or earlier)

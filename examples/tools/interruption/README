Goals:
1. show how tasks, services, and applications can be interrupted
2. if the application exits, tasks and services will be interrupted, tasks first, then services

Notes:
1. this is working, @see InterruptableExampleCommandLineHandler, InterruptableExampleOperatingMode, InterruptableTaskExample, InterruptableServiceExample
2. to perform the same functionality without using the annotations, look at how the annotations are implemented - /advice/shutdownAware
3. implement a sleep in the main application / handler so we can also press CTRL+C to request an abort

this does not run, I think there must be multiple steps to get this to run, see transform.replace_main/1.yaml configuration, it appears to configure a TransformInstanceConfiguration which is used in AgentApplicationInstance
I think the corresponding agent must be provided on the command-line
this could be useful for altering the runtime behavior of an application whilst retaining the source

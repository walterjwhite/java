Goals:
1. show how to use the built-in Java Services pattern in which "services" can be configured at runtime for which implementation you'd like to use:
	@see: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html
2. experiment with this to see what benefits it might provide

Notes:
1. this does not work, this is a placeholder proof of concept and should not take too much effort to get to work

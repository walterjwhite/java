Goals:
1. illustrate the Property API and how properties are set automatically from the environment (proxy)
2. illustrate building a CLI application
3. illustrate ChronoUnit bug fix (property injection with ChronoUnits will now work)

Notes:
1. application works and will print proxy settings (if there are any)

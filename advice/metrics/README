Actions:
1. look for an alternative to prometheus since prometheus must scrape this endpoint
2. implement gauge
   a. simple incrementer/decrementer to measure current items ...
   b. other values such as memory, bytes processes, request size ...
3. automatically create histogram / summary
   a. for timer
   b. request size


NOTES:
1. cannot currently use lombok with aspectj otherwise advice don't work and don't get built
2. prometheus must be configured to scrape this endpoint
   this is automatically done through my linux configuration
3. due to the design, I can only scrape a single application at a time

    I would like to be able to dynamically select an implementation, perhaps just using a Provider<Interface>, the provider will implement the logic


intention of this project was to provide a facility to swap out an implementation for one or another based on policy, application event, etc.

The real use case for this is still being worked out.

Unanswered problems:
1. when switching to another provider, data stored in one provider will not be visible in the other.  Is that okay, desired, or not? - Not sure, still working through the use case.

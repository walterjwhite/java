NOTE:
1. removed next-crawl-view.sql
2. should be able to use new approach for scheduling jobs to manage this automatically
   1. as a Crawl object is created, it will automatically spawn a corresponding job (through the "event" of creating the Crawl object)
   2. for any existing Crawl objects, when the JVM is initialized, a startup job will schedule these jobs to run
